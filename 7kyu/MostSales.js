Instructions:
You work in the best consumer electronics corporation, and your boss wants to find out which three products generate the most revenue. Given 3 lists of the same length like these:

products: ["Computer", "Cell Phones", "Vacuum Cleaner"]
amounts: [3, 24, 8]
prices: [199, 299, 399]
return the three product names with the highest revenue (amount * price).

Note: if multiple products have the same revenue, order them according to their original positions in the input list.
*/

const top3 = (products, amounts, prices) => {
    const revenues = products.map((productName, index) => {
      return {
        name: productName,
        revenue: prices[index] * amounts[index],
        index:index
      }
    });
    const sorted = revenues.sort((a, b) => {
      return b.revenue - a.revenue
    })
    return sorted.slice(0, 3).map((product) => {
      return product.name
    })
  }
