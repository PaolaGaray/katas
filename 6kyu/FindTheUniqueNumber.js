Instructions:
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

    let arrMap = {};
    for (let number of arr) {
      arrMap[number] = arrMap[number] + 1 || 1;

    for(let [key, value] of Object.entries(arrMap)){
      if(value == 1){
